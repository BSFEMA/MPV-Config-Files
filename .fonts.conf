On Linux Mint 19.3, my MPV doesn't correctly display the "Arial" font for:
(1) external .ass subtitles and (2) when the arial.ttf is not included as an attaachment in the mkv file,
but it does display correctly if arial.ttf is included as an attachment in the mkv file.

If I set the the .ass file to use "Arial Regular" (instead of just "Arial") it displays correctly.
Also, for whatever reason, italicized "Arial" worked.

Here are the example .ass script I was testing with:

I have the arial.ttf in my ~/.local/share/fonts (and also tried it in /usr/share/fonts/truetype), but it didn't work.
I saw a post saying that ANA-ONEIROPARMENI82.TTF breaks arial, so I deleted it, but it didn't work.
Running this didn't work either:  $ sudo fc-cache -f -v
"fc-match arial" was returning "arial.ttf: "Arial" "Regular"", which seems correct...

Creating this ~/.fonts.conf file fixed the problem in MPV
This fix is much easier than changing all of my .ass files...
Since my Linux Mint isn't setup to use Arial anywhere, I haven't seen any problems with this "fix".
