MPV Config Files

These are the mpv.conf and input.conf files that I use for MPV running on Linux.

mpv.conf - (I'm still working on this one...)

input.conf - I have setup the keyboard shortcuts, as best as I can, to be the same as Media Player Classic.

scripts\nextfile.lua - slightly modified version of the NextFile script (https://github.com/jonniek/mpv-nextfile)
